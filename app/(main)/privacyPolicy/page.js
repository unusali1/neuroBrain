                    Like most internet-service operators, NeuroBrain also collects
                    non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers,
                    apps and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
                    language preference, geographical location, referring site, and the
                    date and time of each visitor request. The purpose of collecting
                    non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
                    NeuroBrain visitors use its services. From time to time, NeuroBrain
                    may also release non-personally-identifying information in the
                    aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its
                    services. NeuroBrain also collects potentially personally-identifying
                    information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for users that use
                    the services and visitors. For example, if you register for an account
                    with us, we may ask you for personal information such as email, name,
                    contact details, account password, instant messaging ID and/or credit
                    or payment card information. We also collect personal information such
                    as an email address and a name or alias of any Agents you authorize to
                    use the Service in connection with your account and a password from
                    these Agents when they first access the Service. Credit or payment
                    card data is used to process payments for Subscriptions to the
                    Service.
